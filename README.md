# EGAW: Ear Guided Audio Workbench

This is the bachelors degree final project for my software engineer studies. It is a JUCE app that works with real-time audio processing.

## Vision ðŸ‘€
The objective is to build an useful audio workbench focused on mixing and mastering purposes. What makes unique this project is the fact that the whole application has been developed around giving the user an ear guided experience so parameter data and audio visualization will be mostly hidden, thus the user is able to control whatÂ´s happening without deviating the attention to visual references or numbers that condition us as humans and misleads the focus of an audio project paradoxically to non-audio outputs.

## How to install it simplified? ðŸ¤”
Installing the software has been made easy thanks to the installer. For standard users, you will just need to downlaod the installer executable and follow the installation instructions.

For developers you will need to download JUCE from the official website and a code editor, i would personally recommend  Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ package, as it brings many facilities to synchronize your project with JUCE. You will need to open Projucer from JUCE folder and configure your library location, then you will be able to open the jucer project properly.
