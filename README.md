# EGAW: Ear Guided Audio Workbench

This is the bachelors degree final project for my software engineer studies. It is a JUCE app that works with real-time audio processing.

## Vision ðŸ‘€
The objective is to build an useful audio workbench focused on mixing and mastering purposes. What makes unique this project is the fact that the whole application has been developed around giving the user an ear guided experience so parameter data and audio visualization will be mostly hidden, thus the user is able to control whatÂ´s happening without deviating the attention to visual references or numbers that condition us as humans and misleads the focus of an audio project paradoxically to non-audio outputs.

## Actual state of the project ðŸ‘·
This is currently the 0.1 version. It is only a really simple mixer app demo where you can route channels, pan and set the gain, among other customization options. Render is actually fixed to 5 seconds.

## How to use it simplified? ðŸ¤”
In this build there is no proper installer or a full developed method for this. To use it simply go to the "Build" folder and download de executable to use it.
